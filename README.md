Repository Description: .NET Web API Microservices with Authentication and Authorization

This repository hosts a comprehensive implementation of .NET Web API microservices designed to facilitate robust authentication and authorization mechanisms. The backend microservices are developed using .NET Web API, ensuring efficient handling of HTTP requests and responses.

Key Features:

Authentication and Authorization: The microservices incorporate robust authentication and authorization mechanisms to ensure secure access control. Authentication is implemented to validate the identity of users accessing the system, while authorization mechanisms ensure that users are granted appropriate access rights based on their roles and permissions.

Role-Based Authorization: Role-based authorization is integrated into the system to enforce access control policies based on predefined user roles. This ensures that different users have access to specific functionalities and resources based on their roles within the system.

Front-End Handling with .NET MVC: The front-end aspect of the application is handled using .NET MVC, providing a structured and efficient framework for building dynamic and interactive user interfaces. .NET MVC enables seamless integration with the backend microservices, ensuring smooth communication between the presentation layer and the business logic.

Azure Message Bus Integration: The repository leverages Azure Message Bus to facilitate efficient communication and data exchange between microservices. Specifically, the message bus is utilized to store cart updates, allowing for asynchronous processing and decoupling of components. This ensures scalability, reliability, and fault tolerance in handling cart-related operations.

Queue Service Bus for Cart Details: Cart details are stored and managed using a queue service bus within the Azure ecosystem. This architecture ensures reliable and asynchronous processing of cart-related data, enhancing performance and scalability while maintaining data consistency and integrity.

Technologies Used:

.NET Web API
.NET MVC
Azure Message Bus
Azure Queue Service Bus
Authentication and Authorization mechanisms
Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)
Purpose:

The repository serves as a comprehensive reference and implementation guide for developers looking to build scalable, secure, and efficient web applications using .NET technologies. It provides insights into best practices for implementing authentication, authorization, microservices architecture, and message-driven communication within the Azure ecosystem.
